## Python

A python course for undergrad and grad students I teach at HU
Berlin. We introduce python in general and some more scientific
packages like numpy and pandas. Please have a look at the course [website](http://jaguar.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~max/python_course/python_course_2014.html).

### Introduction to Regular Expressions

One part of the Python course that is useful even for non-python users
is about regular expressions. We [introduce](regex_new.pdf) regex and give the students
a website full of obfuscated email adresses to match.

## R

An R [bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org) course I did a couple of years ago for students
at HU Berlin. It is a brief introduction into micro-array analysis. Here are some [slides](microarray_r.pdf) we prepared for it.
